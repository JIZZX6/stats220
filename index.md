<p>OK, Here my index.md file needs contain information about the meme I created,
for example, what the motivation was, and how my meme is new/original (e.g. an 
adaption of an existing meme format)</p>

Let's do it!

**There are two reasons why I create this meme:**

1. I need to complete the assignment
2. I really don't want bad teammates in game
